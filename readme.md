## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

This project is a web application for managing soccer players and their performance. Users can create, update, and view player profiles, which include information such as name, position, team, and performance.

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You need to have the following software installed on your system:

- Node.js
- npm
- MongoDB


### Installing

1. Clone the repository

2. Navigate to the project directory

3. Install the dependencies

4. Start the development server

The application should now be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

## 🔧 Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>

Currently, there are no tests for this project. If you plan to add tests, explain how to run them here.
